Initially, the focus was on shoes, but this gradually evolved over time to include bags, jewelry, and accessories, giving users the whole package.

        As the business increased its offering, this also meant that the workload grew too. Karolina has been with aeyde since the beginning and has seen the company grow from a small startup to the successful business it is today. She originally started out as a freelancer, but after seeing the potential in the company, she decided to stay on and become a part of the team. 
        <br/> <br/>
        Today, Karolina is responsible for overseeing the development of the website and all of the company's retouching needs. She has a keen eye for detail and takes great pride in his work, making sure that every product looks perfectbefore it goes live on the site. Thanks to Karolina's skills and dedication, Zoom Tech Street has become a trusted partner of aeyde, providing high-quality retouching services.`,
